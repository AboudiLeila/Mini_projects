So i recently broke my phone. The biggest matter is waking up! As I need noisy or powerful songs,
the default songs of my 2 PCs actually were making me sleep even deep, instead of waking me ðŸ™„.

So one thing led to another, I came out with this Alarm Clock and The one in the Streamlit repository.

I hope you'll have the same as me !

i recently included some songs so i don't have to look for them each time:
